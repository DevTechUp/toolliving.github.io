But I can not help but ask, when we discuss the window management, we are talking about what? In fact, the focus of the discussion should be on the use of window management habits and scenes, followed by App is the choice. But most people do not know their own habits at first, so this article from the use of personal habits, to provide a reference for everyone. My MacBook is connected to a large screen and then uses a USB keyboard with a Bluetooth mouse, so the touchpad is almost out of reach. MouseIf you often play FPS games you may understand the importance of the function keys outside the left mouse button. I use the Logitech M558 mouse, there are two function keys can greatly facilitate me to multi-window / multi-desktop switch. M558 mouse wheel is not only the middle mouse button, or a left and right toggle “joystick”, feel very good, very convenient to switch between the desktop. For ordinary users, the mouse can complete some keyboard inconvenience to complete the operation, such as file drag and drop, file selection, etc., these operations will most of the multi-window / desktop switching operation linkage. Therefore, the operation of these on the mouse for me is the most simple and convenient. Of course, with the function keys of the mouse not only M558, you can also buy your favorite mouse shape and brand. HyperDock - efficient window dynamic adjustment schemeHyperDock can achieve the following two functions: Window screen edge adaptive (similar to Win7 system screen edge layout function) Mouse drag window to adjust the window size Among them, the function can be said that I bought HyperDock the main reason, before entering the macOS, I used Ubuntu system, it native support Alt key mouse click on any part of the window to drag the window. I thought macOS is one of the UNIX-based systems, should also have such a function, but in the end still need to make up HyperDock. HyperDock also allows you to adjust the window size by dragging and dropping the mouse at any position in the window (only from the lower right corner, see the figure), reducing the precision of the operation requirements - you do not have to accurately aim the window edge and other indicators into a double arrow To adjust. Moom / Magnet - efficient window static layout schemeOver 70% of the case, I have to use the mouse function keys HyperDock to dynamically adjust the window. In addition to less than three percent, I will use the keyboard shortcuts to achieve efficient window static layout. Moom (or Magnet) can help me complete these less than 30% of the static layout operations: Full-screen browser (not ^ cover F that exclusive full screen) Browser writing App, PDF reading notes App, etc. - double App form of 1/2 split screen Quickly center a window at the edge of the screen Magnet can achieve HyperDock 1. Window screen edge adaptive function, but also support shortcut keys operation. But Magnet can only let the window up / down / left / right half screen, full screen, center. For ordinary users, Magnet can replace the following Moom, and if you do not need the mouse to drag and adjust the window, it can even replace HyperDock. Moom is the advanced version of Magnet, it can be divided into a × b (0 &lt;a, b &lt;26) block, and then customize the shortcut keys to fill the window to these blocks. For example, you can customize the shortcut keys to make the window 13/17 screen - is not the angle tricky? In short, Moom can meet many special needs. Moom can also customize the combination of multi-application window arrangement. For example, in the use of Ulysses writing, you may need to open Evernote to refer to the previously prepared outline, while in Safari search for the necessary information. You can set the three windows fixed mode set to Moom shortcut keys, when the three applications open at the same time, press the shortcut keys will be able to automatically arrange - very Professional, for me these functions are excess, but Moom There are still a lot of target users. The following is an example of a combination of Safari Evernote, in any case to adjust the size and location of the two application windows, can be a key to restore to the default size and location. Drag/Drop Way to adjust the windowWindow Tidy and Mosaic belong ‘Drag/Drop + Floating panel’form: When you drag the window, the faceplate appears in the screen, which contains many preset and custom permutations, and you can resize and position the window to one of them. The following is the Window Tidy operation demonstration. I am not accustomed to this operation: on the one hand, this operation requires a certain degree of operational accuracy - in the case of more expensive grid prone to misuse, and the window from the left to move to the right side of the floating panel , The efficiency is not improved; the other hand, the floating panel will block the screen part, like iOS 11 before the system volume panel as annoying.","categories":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/"},{"name":"Window","slug":"Mac/Window","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/Window/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Mac/"},{"name":"Window","slug":"Window","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Window/"}]},{"title":"Want to catch the thieves who steal time, you need this Tomato clock: Tomates","slug":"Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates","date":"2017-07-19T13:25:00.000Z","updated":"2017-07-18T13:43:14.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/07/19/Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/2017/07/19/Want-to-catch-the-thieves-who-steal-time-you-need-this-Tomato-clock-Tomates/","excerpt":"Open the App Store, find yourself into the focus of the application, there will be a variety of Tomato applications appear. It can seize the time of the thief!","text":"Open the App Store, find yourself into the focus of the application, there will be a variety of Tomato applications appear. It can seize the time of the thief! Seize the “time thief” is the key to time managementTomato work method can be used effectively to assess the working status of the day, but one day down, I found myself on average to complete eight or so tomato time, that is effective working hours only 4 hours. But I feel that work is more than a moment, then the rest of the time where to go? Tomates’ Thiefs function can play a role in this scene. Thiefs is actually similar to RescueTime time tracking function. When you first allow the software to track your browser, Tomates will record the length of the application you’ve used on your Mac and the page you’re viewing. And those nonproductive software and web pages, such as YouTube, will be defined as “Thiefs”, of course, you can also customize a software or website for Thiefs. One day you can view your own records in chronological order, and Thiefs can be displayed separately. Without RescueTime so powerful and detailed analysis, Thiefs can only show the use of Mac on a linear record. But with my tomato time record, you can see in the end which applications or web pages, in the tomato time, the occupation of my time and energy. Then with the Focus interception software, Thiefs will be added to the intercept list, will be able to prevent them again “burglary” my time. Pay attention to the review and statistics of the Pomodoro applicationEvery morning when combing today’s to-do, I used to look at the previous day and last week’s tomato record, so come to estimate the number of tomatoes that can be done today. Tomato potatoes are only a list of tomato records in the form of a list, and Tomates has a special “review” window, elegant to the form of time axis to show, look at a lot of intuitive. And the calendar comes with a daily view of the calendar, the progress of today’s day there is a general estimate. And to the statistical interface, can provide more information and show the form. According to the classification of statistics, a week (month) trend, the time distribution of tomato pie pie, readily available. What are the scenarios for Tomates?Although both are used for the Pomodoro, Tomates and Tomato Potatoes have their own advantages and disadvantages, which determine their different use scenarios. Tomates combines time tracking, but it is weak on the combination with the to-do list. Although it is possible to add a completed item for the Pomodoro, there is no separate window, it is convenient to operate with tomato potatoes and can not add a label to the matter. In the latter part of the statistics, obviously the same project, such as the article “write outline” “complete draft” and “edit article”, was identified as a different task. While in the potato potatoes by adding one So if you look at its Thiefs function and do not have too many tedious things to use with the tomato work method every day, just need it for the Pomodoro function, then Tomates will sort out your time well.","categories":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/"},{"name":"Time","slug":"Mac/Time","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/Mac/Time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Mac","slug":"Mac","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Mac/"},{"name":"Time","slug":"Time","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Time/"},{"name":"Record","slug":"Record","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Record/"}]},{"title":"SendAnywhere - Free full platform file sharing tool","slug":"SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool","date":"2017-07-18T13:33:00.000Z","updated":"2017-07-18T13:30:50.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/07/18/SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/2017/07/18/SendAnywhere-Free-full-platform-file-sharing-tool/","excerpt":"I recently discovered this easy to use professional platform sharing tool: SendAnywhere.

Unfortunately, AirDroid only for the Android system services, Pushbullet need to log through the Google account, the transmission of large files worrying. Covering the entire platform of the clientFor a file transfer software, the supported platform is very important, directly affecting the number of devices available for use and transmission.Similar to other file transfer software, you need to install a client before you want to use SendAnywhere. And SendAnywhere coverage is very wide, can be regarded as a full platform. Mobile has a regular iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and even provides a Kindle version Desktop side is Windows (UWP and Win32 version), macOS, Linux version, also provides the Outlook plug-in. Web page has a web version, Chrome extension, Chrome app, Office 365 Outlook web page plugin, also opened the Wordpress plugin, Slack plugin, Gmail plugin, and provided to other browsers API. Key, two-dimensional, code link, share files everywhereSendAnywhere in terms of sharing can be said to be another way.There are three ways to share: “6-digit key”, “two-dimensional code sharing” and “sharing link”. Speed transmission and quick sharing, with data to speakAs the network conditions are different, I own the actual experience for everyone to make a reference. I use the 6-bit key to share the form, in the LAN environment from the iPhone to the PC directly to the transmission of 79 photos, a total of 151 MB, time-consuming 16 seconds. The average speed of 9.43 MB / s, with two-dimensional code to share the effect is the same. I use the 6-bit key to share the form, in the 4G environment from the iPhone to the PC to transmit 151 MB of photos, time-consuming 32 seconds, the average speed of 4.71 MB / s. This can also be seen as “through 6-bit key to share to friends” simulation test. I use the link to share the way, the same transmission 151 MB of photos. IPhone side upload takes 2 minutes and 45 seconds, the average speed of 0.92 MB / s. Received in the computer side of the file, download time 36 seconds, the average speed of 4.19 MB / s. This data depends on the upstream and downstream network speed, may be different. ) Through the results of this experiment summed up some of the experience, the dry goods posted for your reference: In the backup photo to the computer, the preferred use of 6-bit key form, the speed can reach the full speed of the network transmission. In a short time (10 minutes) to share with friends, it is recommended to choose 6 key transmission, the speed is quite fast. Depending on the slower side of the two sides. If the two sides of the network speed is not equal (one very slow), it is recommended to select the link to share. A short period of time the other party can not receive, then select the link to share, the file will be stored on the server for 48 hours. Beyond the sharing of local area network, regardless of network disk restrictionsThere are a lot of file transfer software is the limitations of “local area network”, file sharing software is usually limited (such as a single file size, video format, etc.), and these are precisely the advantages of SendAnywhere. The above mentioned several sharing operations are not limited to local area network. Again, not limited to local area network. With 6-bit key sharing, you can directly transfer between the two devices are not suitable for the existence of important files within the network disk. Use the link to share, it means that your friends can not download this software, you can directly open the link to download. Information age to share files, safety firstThe security of file transfers is also an important factor in our choice of transferring software, especially if the link sharing to the server needs to be compromised. File transfer using the 6-digit key transfers files directly between the two devices, and does not store files on the server. So you do not have to worry about file leaks. For link sharing and send to device, files are uploaded to the server temporarily. All files are encrypted and stored to protect against external attacks and spills. Stored files are automatically deleted from the server after expiration. At the time of transmission, the file is encrypted and transmitted so that the contents of the file being transferred can not be known by others. SummaryIn the file transfer and sharing, SendAnywhere only full platform and free client download files these two conscience function can go beyond many similar software. SendAnywhere provides the idea of sharing files, that is, through the network disk, directly transfer files between devices. The benefits of this are very obvious, we do not have to worry about the file was leaked, do not have to worry about the contents of the third party to see. Also due to network speed constraints, I do not think the current file transfer tool can completely replace the data lines, but excellent file transfer software can still save us a lot of time and the trouble of plugging data lines, especially in the backup photos, SendAnywhere Also provides the option to “back up all photos”, which is not lost to the data line experience.","categories":[{"name":"File","slug":"File","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/categories/File/"}],"tags":[{"name":"File","slug":"File","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/File/"},{"name":"Share","slug":"Share","permalink":"https://www.toolliving.com/tags/Share/"}]}]}
